module SO2DB

  # Base class for StackOverflow data importers.  Drives database setup and
  # data importing files from a directory.
  #
  # Implementations of this class must provide a method with the following 
  # signature:
  #
  #   import_stream(formatter)
  #
  # This method may be private.  The purpose of this method is to actually
  # perform the data import with data from the provided formatter.  The
  # formatter is provided to support scenarios of streaming data to STDIN 
  # (e.g., PostgreSQL's COPY command) as well as pushing data to a file before 
  # import (e.g., for MySQL's mysqlimport utility).  It has type 
  # SO2DB::Formatter.
  #
  # The importer uses ActiveRecord for table creation and Foreigner for creating
  # table relationships. You are limited to the databases supported by these 
  # libraries.  In addition, a 'uuid' method must be avaiable to the adapter
  # provided to ActiveRecord.  (See so2pg for an example of an adapter extension
  # that provides the method.)
  #
  # In addition, it provides two accessors for subclasses:
  #
  #   attr_reader :conn_opts
  #   attr_accessor :delimiter
  #
  # The conn_opts property provides the ActiveRecord connection data (e.g., 
  # :database, :host, etc.).  The delimiter property sets the delimiter used by
  # the formatter.  The delimiter is \v (0xB) by default.
  class Importer

    # Initializes the importer.
    #
    # Arguments:
    #   relations: (Boolean) Indicates whether database relationships should
    #                        be created.
    #   optionals: (Boolean) Indicates whether optional database tables and
    #                        content should be created.
    #   adapter:   (String)  The ActiveRecord adapter name (e.g., 'postgresql').
    #   options:   (Hash)    The database connection options, as required by
    #                        ActiveRecord for the provided adapter.
    def initialize(relations = false, optionals = false, adapter = '', options = {})
      @relations = relations
      @optionals = optionals
      @conn_opts = options.merge( { :adapter => adapter } )
      @format_delimiter = 11.chr.to_s
    end

    # Creates the database tables and relationships, and imports the data in
    # the files in the specified directory.  
    #
    # Arguments:
    #   dir:  (String) The directory path containting the StackOverflow data
    #                  dump XML files (e.g., badges.xml, posts.xml, etc.).
